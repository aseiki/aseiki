**aseiki/aseiki** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on personal projects involving Web Dev
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning React
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open sources projects related to Web
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: aseikiaragaki@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: There are no repositories here :S
